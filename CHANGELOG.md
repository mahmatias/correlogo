- Fixed: Dark mode preference persistence (now correctly loads from Firebase or system preference).
- Fixed: Workout completion logic, including automatic confirmation prompt and state resetting.
- Fixed: Issue preventing starting a new workout after finishing one, by ensuring proper component re-initialization via the `key` prop on `WorkoutTracker` in `App.tsx`.
